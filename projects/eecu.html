        <p id="desc">EECU presented to us at CART about how to balance our budget. This was so that when we did not have our parents for support we could survive on our own. After our little activity we were tasked to create an online calculator that would do all of the tax deductions for the user. This was the only project we did where I did not work for my own besides at the end to really fix the site up. It was an insane experience communicating to people what I wanted and exactly how I wanted it done. I learned how to really manage my time and a developer within the 2 week period we did this. I faced some pretty big challanges such as utilizing a graphing library for a pie chart.</p>
