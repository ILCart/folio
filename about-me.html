        <p>My name is Isaac Lay. I am currently a student at the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART)  as well as Buchanan High School. I will graduate in 2025. This year I am enrolled in the Web Application Development Lab. I am a Junior and this is my first year at CART. I hope to get an internship in my freshman year of college under a small company. I want to continue creating websites but if something were to happen I would instead do analysis on big datasets. I know for sure that I want to be in a career that works with or on computers and new technology. I have had a drive and passion for technology ever since I got my hands on it in 2011.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3>Lion Dance</h3>
        <p>In my freshmen year of high school my sister told me to join BHS's lion dance team. At the time I was just thinking about it and in my sophmore year I decided, why not? So in the sophmore year I started lion dancing. Every week for 2 hours we would practice in the hallway outside of the Chinese classroom. It was fun but also stressful there was many times where my team would plan on the spot on what to do which I think is just part of the trade.</p>
