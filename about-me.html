                <p>In my freshmen year of high school my sister told me to join BHS's lion dance team. At the time I was
                    just
                    thinking about it and in my sophmore year I decided, why not? So in my sophmore year I started lion
                    dancing. Every week for 2 hours we would practice in the hallway outside of the Chinese classroom. It
                    was
                    fun but also stressful there were many times where my team would plan on the spot on what to do. Quick thinking and being robust allowed me and my team to persevere and
                    execute
                    great lion dances.</p>

            <p>My junior year of highschool I noticed that our lion needed many repairs. The eyes were drooping the jaw
                was slipping and much more. I stepped up and have been the sole maintainer of the lion for about a year.
                It has been fun and I like being able to create systems that make me and my teams performances a lot
                easier.</p>

                <p>When I started my first year of highschool the first club I joined was the Chinese Cultural Club at BHS.
                    I attended meetings and learnt about what makes China so interesting. In my sophmore year I ran for the
                    nex club president and won. Once my junior year started I got threw into the world of chaos that is
                    managing a club. I learnt a great deal about China and had a lot of fun while doing it. The biggest
                    event of the year for the club is the field trip to San Francisco's Chinatown. I ran for the same
                    position again my junior year and won again.</p>

                and what makes them work always fasinated me. Tinkering with RC cars and toys I would have was a great
                deal of my childhood. As I grew older I picked up scripting from Roblox and that transfered to
                JavaScript and CSS for web design.</p>

                is so cool! The natural formation of the things around us is just so beautiful and capturing it is one
                of my hobbies. This also branched off into creaing posters and creating visually interesting graphics.
